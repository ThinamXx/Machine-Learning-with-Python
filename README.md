# **Machine Learning with Python**

In this repository, I have includes all basic and fundamentals implementations of Python and it's alias in Machine Learning. They are summarized below:

### **Linear Models and Optimization**
- In statistics, the term linear model is used in different ways according to the context. The most common occurrence is in connection with regression models and the term is often taken as synonymous with linear regression model.

### **Classifier Visualization**

### **Gradient Boosting Decision Trees**
- Here, I tried to answer only one question: **Will performance of GBDT model drop dramatically if we remove the first tree?**

### **KNeighbors Classifier**
- You can get insights about the selection of variours Hyper-parameters and it's tuning.
